<h1 align="center">Predicting Used Car Prices in India</h1>

<p align="center">The aim of the project is to be able to price a used car in India that has not yet been sold based on its features and prices of other similar cars that have been sold. Regression machine learning algorithms are used to build models to achieve this. Data was obtained from CarDekho - an online used car sales platform - via Kaggle. The dataset contains information on used cars previously sold on the website.</p>
